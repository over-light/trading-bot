# Orderbook Delta Bot

A trading bot written in Rust ðŸ¦€.

The strategy based on the concept of *mean reversion*. We look for large deviations in the volume delta of BTC-PERP on
FTX until a defined depth.
These deviations could be caused by over-enthusiastic and over-leveraged market participants (speculation).

We counter-trade those deviations, and enter short/long positions based on triggers given by a large deviation
(> 2 SDs) on the orderbook delta from a 20 period rolling bollinger band.

We are testing this with BTC-PERP on FTX, which has good liquidity and small spreads (~~and FTX~~ now Binance, praise be to CZ, has the best API
in the business). In principle, the scheme could be modified for lower liquidity pairs too, perhaps by adjusting
the sampling period and market depth for generating triggers.

We use the definitions:

| Name            | Definition                                                             |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `bid_ask_delta` | Difference between the sum of bid and ask volumes till a defined depth |
| `bb.upper`      | Upper bollinger band (L=20, SD=2) of `bid_ask_delta`                   |
| `bb.lower`      | Lower bollinger band (L=20, SD=2) of `bid_ask_delta`                   |

| Trigger                    | Position |
|----------------------------|----------|
| `bid_ask_delta > bb.upper` | short    |
| `bid_ask_delta < bb.lower` | long     |

## Orderbook Delta GUI (optional delta strategy tester)

To test out new delta strategies and visualize them live, use the orderbook-delta-visualizer. 
It's written in Python, with plotting handled by Dash and Plotly, and contains a set of configurable parameters 
and strategies. See `orderbook-delta-visualizer/` for more details.

## Settings

`settings.json` contains all the configurable options:

| Name              | Explanation                                                            |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `market_name`     | Name of futures market on FTX (default: BTC-PERP)                      |
| `sampling_time`   | Time (in seconds) to sample orderbook, each sample is 1s (default: 60) |
| `bb_period`       | Bollinger band period (default: 20)                                    |
| `bb_std_dev`      | Bollinger band standard deviation (default: 2)                         |
| `orderbook_depth` | Depth of orderbook to sum (default: 5)                                 |
| `live`            | Place live orders on FTX, requires API keys in `.env` (default: false) |
| `order_size`      | Size of order to place (default: 0.1618 BTC)                           |
| `tp_percent`      | Percent move to take profit at (default: 0.2%)                         |
| `sl_percent`      | Percent move to stop loss at (default: 0.1%)                           |
| `write_to_file`   | Store positions in a csv file for further analysis (default: true)     |

## TODO

- [ ] Use Kelly criterion for order sizing (probabilities can be estimated from prior analysis)
- [ ] Use dynamic take profit and stop loss based on market movement (this is simply used as protection from getting
  rekt, not as actual exit points)
- [ ] Perform spectral analysis with wider timeframes to identify optimal
  market conditions
- [ ] Switch to websockets API for reduced data query lag
- [ ] For more high frequency applications, switching to a library
  like [ccapi](https://github.com/crypto-chassis/ccapi/) is handy. Unfortunately this only exists for C++ right now.
